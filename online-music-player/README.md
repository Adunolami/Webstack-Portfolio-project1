## Full Stack Development Project

Welcome to my latest project! This portfolio project showcases the development of an `Online Music Player`. Built using `React` for the frontend and `Node.js` for the backend, it includes features like user authentication, music search, playlist creation, and music controls (play, pause, skip, forward, rewind).
